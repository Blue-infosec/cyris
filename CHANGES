CyRIS v0.2
----------
* Changed format of configuration file CONFIG, and the section name
  [config] is now required; parameter names use lower case, and
  ABS_PATH has been renamed to cyris_path for clarity
* Added the tag "full_name" to the "add_account" operation, so that
  the user's full name can also be specified for new accounts.
* Set "yum" as default package manager, hence the "package_manager"
  field can now be omitted in "install_package" if the target OS is
  CentOS or equivalent
* Fixed error in DMZ example by which the "forwarding_rules" field in
  the "guests" section of "clone_setttings" was incorrectly written as
  "firewall_rules"
* Minor improvements and bug fixes
