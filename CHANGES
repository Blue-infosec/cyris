CyRIS v0.2
----------
* Simplified README.md as most information is in User Guide
* Added a generic multi-host description sample
* Modified some directory and file names for consistency
* Eliminated use of literal 'host_1' id in code related to pscp
* Changed format of configuration file CONFIG, and the section name
  [config] is now required; parameter names use lower case, and
  ABS_PATH has been renamed to cyris_path for clarity
* Fixed error in DMZ example by which the "forwarding_rules" field in
  the "guests" section of "clone_setttings" was incorrectly written as
  "firewall_rules"
* Set "yum" as default package manager, hence the "package_manager"
  field can now be omitted in "install_package" if the target OS is
  CentOS or equivalent
* Added the tag "full_name" to the "add_account" operation, so that
  the user's full name can also be specified for new accounts.
* Other minor improvements and bug fixes
